      Sum square difference
      Problem 6
      
      The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
      12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
      
      The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
      (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
      
      Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
      numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
      
      Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
      natural numbers and the square of the sum.
